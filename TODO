# Theory topics

- explain why we should hash ciphertext and/or (plaintext *and* a secret)

# Misc

- move "tangents" (as pointed out by michael) to better places, maybe appendix

- It'd be easier to read if some typographic conventions are
  honoured in the writing. I'd suggest to use :math:``
  environments for all formulaic content as well as variable
  references. This would render variables (such as "u" and "a")
  usually in italics, and make reading much simpler.
