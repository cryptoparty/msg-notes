# Theory topics

- more arguments around causal ordering and buffering
  - "display immediately" strategy only guarantees to "1-level parent only"; rest of history forgeable
  - buffering can be invisible to end-user, so no visible degradation (weak point though)

- linearisation - could minor-warn/notice for messages that are "badly-ordered"
- mention a server-dictated order

- probably split up "ordering"

- clarify that warnings are persistent-state rather than point-events
  - different terminology? maybe "set warn-state"

- ack timing rules, cancel warn-states after full-ack
- discuss overhead of acks

- maybe split recovery/resends/dupes into separate "reliability" chapter
- discuss end-to-end reliability and server limited reliability
  - how reliability and consistency should be together
  - why incremental consistency is important

- refine auto-deletion of old ciphertext that has been full-acked (cf code)
- refine resends of previous explicit-acks (cf code)

- explain why we should hash ciphertext and/or (plaintext *and* a secret)

# Misc

- move "tangents" (as pointed out by michael) to better places, maybe appendix

- It'd be easier to read if some typographic conventions are
  honoured in the writing. I'd suggest to use :math:``
  environments for all formulaic content as well as variable
  references. This would render variables (such as "u" and "a")
  usually in italics, and make reading much simpler.
